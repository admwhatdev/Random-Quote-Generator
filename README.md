# Random Quote Generator
 Team Treehouse Techdegree Project

For this project I had to develop a Random Quote generator by using an object within an array. 

The issues I had were implementing an if statement that was as concise as it could be and read well. Originally I had numerous else statements and it wouldn't have immediately made sense to a third-party.

To overcome this I re-read the project instructions and found a hint that they were looking for 2 if statements. At this stage I realized that an if statement does not require an accompanying else statement and so re-worked the code to be more tangible. 

I am attempting to be graded as Exceeds Expectations and as so my script contains:
- One additional property tag that is run in the script.
- A 10 second interval that reloads the page
- A random background generator.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and please check out my script. Any feedback is greatly appreciated also.
